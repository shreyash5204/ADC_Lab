    <h3>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</h3>
<p> A modulation technique where the width of the pulses
     of the pulsed carrier wave is changed according to the modulating 
     signal is known as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). 
    It is also known as Pulse duration modulation (PDM).</p>

    <h3>Generation Of PWM Block Diagram Representaion </h3>

    <p>The message signal and the carrier waveform is fed to a modulator which generates PAM signal. 
        This pulse amplitude modulated signal is fed to the
         non-inverting terminal of the comparator.</p>

         <p>A ramp signal generated by the sawtooth generator is fed
             to the inverting terminal of the comparator.</p>

             <p>These two signals are added and compared with the reference voltage
                 of the comparator circuit. The level of the comparator is so adjusted
                 to have the intersection of the reference with the slope of the waveform.</p>

                 <p>The PWM pulse begins with the leading edge of the ramp signal and the 
                    width of the pulse is determined by the comparator circuit.</p>
