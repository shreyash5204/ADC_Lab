<h3>Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)</h3>
<p>When a digital signal undergoes Pulse Code Modulation,
     it converts the analog information into a binary sequence (1 and 0). 
     Through the demodulation process, we can obtain the original analog signal. The figure below 
    represents the output of the PCM signal with respect to the sine wave.</p>

<p>Pulse Code Modulation techniques are used to produce a series of numbers or digits in binary form.
     Hence this process is called digital modulation.
     The amplitude at that particular time of the signal sample is indicated by the binary codes.</p>

     <p>In the PCM process, a sequence of coded pulses indicates the message signal.
         This message signal represents amplitude and time.</p>

         <h3>Block diagram of the Pulse Code Modulation process is as shown in the figure below.</h3>

         <p>In the PCM process, it is possible to digitise all forms of analog 
            data, including music, telemetry, voice, full-motion video. To obtain
             a pulse code modulated waveform from an analog waveform at the transmitter
              end and to convert the message 
            signal into the binary form, a process known as quantisation is used.</p>

            <p>At the receiver end of the pulse code circuit, demodulation takes place,
                 and the signal is converted into pulses with the same quantum levels.</p>

                 <h3>Advantages Of PCM</h3>
