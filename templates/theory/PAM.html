<h3>What is Pulse Amplitude Modulation?</h3>


<p>Pulse amplitude modulation is a technique in which the amplitude of 
    each pulse is controlled by the instantaneous amplitude of the modulation 
    signal. It is a modulation system in which the signal is sampled at regular
     intervals and each sample is made proportional to the amplitude of the signal
      at the instant of sampling. This technique transmits the data by 
    encoding in the amplitude of a series of signal pulses.</p>

    <p>There are two types of sampling techniques for transmitting a signal using PAM. They are:</p>

    <h4>1. Flat Top PAM</h4>
     <h4>2. Natural PAM</h4>

     <h3>Flat Top PAM</h3>
     <p> The amplitude of each pulse is directly proportional to modulating 
        signal amplitude at the time of pulse occurrence. The amplitude of the signal
         cannot be changed with respect to the
         analog signal to be sampled. The tops of the amplitude remain flat.</p>

         <h3>Natural PAM</h3>
         <p>The amplitude of each pulse is directly proportional
             to modulating signal amplitude at the time of pulse occurrence. Then follows the 
            amplitude of the pulse for the rest of the half-cycle</p>

            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It is a simple process for both modulation and demodulation.</li>
                <li>Transmitter and receiver circuits are simple and easy to construct.</li>
                <li>PAM can generate other pulse modulation signals and can carry the message at the same time.</li>
                <li>The data can be transmitted quickly, efficiently, and effectively through usual copper wires in high volume.</li>
                <li>For all types of digital modulation methods, it is the base and simple method for both modulation & demodulation.</li>
                <li></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bandwidth should be large for transmission PAM modulation.</li>
                <li>Noise will be great.</li>
                <li>Pulse amplitude signal varies so the power required for transmission will be more.</li>
                <li>For transmitting PAM signal, BW must be large</li>
    
            </ol>

     <h3>Applications of PAM</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>It is used in Ethernet communication.</li>
        <li>It is used in many micro-controllers for generating control signals.</li>
        <li>It is used in Photo-biology.</li>
        <li>It is used as an electronic driver for LED lighting.</li>
        <li>The control signals can be generated in various microcontrollers by using PAM</li>
