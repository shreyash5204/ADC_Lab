<h3> What is Quantization ? </h3>
<p>In a communication system, sometimes happen that we
     are available with an analog signal, however,
      we have to transmit a digital signal for a particolar application.
      In such a case, we have to convert an analog signal into a digital signal. 
      This means that we have to convert
     a continuous-time signal into the form of digits</p>

     <h3> Types of Quantization </h3>

    <h3>The quantization process can be classified into two types:</h3>

    <h4>(i) Uniform Quantization</h4>
    <p> A uniform quantizer is that type of quantizer
         in which the step size remains the same through the input range.</p>

         <h4>Non-uniform Quantizer: </h4>
         <p>A non-uniform quantizer is that type of quantizer in which the step size varies according to the input signal values.</p>
     

         <h3>Types of Uniform Quantizer</h3>
         <p>There are two types of uniform quantizers:</p>
         <h4>(i) Symmetric quantizer of the midtread type</h4>
         <h4>(ii) Symmetric quantizer of the midrise type</h4>

         <ol>
            <li>Basically, the quantizer can be of a uniform or non-uniform type.
                 In a uniform quantizer, the representation
                 levels are uniformly spaced; otherwise, the quantizer is non-uniform.</li>

         </ol>

         <img src="https://i0.wp.com/easyelectronics.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/types-of-uniform-quantization.jpg?w=696&ssl=1">

         <h3>2. Non-Uniform Quantizer</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>If the quantizer characteristics are non-linear and the steep size is not
                 constant instead if it is variable, dependent o the amplitude of the input
                 signal then the quantization is known as non-uniform quantization.</li>

                 <li>In non-uniform quantization, the step size is reduced with the
                    reduction in signal levels. For weak signals, the step size is small,
                     therefore the quantization noise reduces
                     to improve the signal to quantization noise ratio for weak signals.</li>

                     <li>The step size is thus varied according to the signal levels to keep the
                         signal-to-noise ratio adequately high.
                         This is non-uniform quantization.</li>
                         <li>The non-uniform quantization is practically achieved 
                            through a process called companding.</li>
         </ol>
