<h3>Sampling</h3>

<p>Sampling in statistics or research is defined as a method to
     select a subset from the large data. In digital communication,
      it is defined as a process of measuring the instantaneous
     value of an analog signal in the discrete form.</p>

     <p>Sampling is a process performed by a sampler.
         It is present in almost every type of digital communication 
         system that helps in converting an analog signal to the digital signal.
          An analog signal is a continuous time-varying signal, while digital signal 
          is a signal in the discrete form. The function of a sampler is to measure
           the samples of the instantaneous 
        value of the continuous signal and convert it into the discrete values.</p>

        <p>The combination of quantizer and sampler in digital communications
             works as an A/D (Analog to Digital) converter. It converts an incoming
              analog signal to the digital signal. The sampler converts the analog signal
               to the discrete values and the quantizer represent each level to the fixed 
               discrete finite set of values. Thus, we can define the analog to digital conversion
                as a two step process. The first step is performed by the sampler and the second 
            step is performed by the quantizer.</p>

            <p>The waveforms of a continuous analog signal and digital signal are shown below:</p>

            <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/digital-communication/images/sampling.png">
            <p>When the continuous signal is sampled at regular intervals and multiplied by a periodic pulse train, 
                the produced signal is the sampled signal, as shown below:</p>

                <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/digital-communication/images/sampling2.png">

                <p>Here, we will discuss the sampling theorem, sampling rate,
                     Nyquist rate, methods of sampling, anti-aliasing filter,
                      advantages of sampling, disadvantages
                     of sampling, and applications of sampling.</p>

                     <h3>Sampling theorem</h3>
                     <p>Sampling theorem is based on the fixed sampling rate, called Nyquist rate.
                        Hence, sampling theorem is also known as Nyquist theorem. It is based on the 
                        theory of the bandlimited signals.

                        Let's discuss the sampling theorem of the bandpass signals and baseband signals.</p>

                        <p>According to the sampling theory of the bandpass signals,
                             a signal can be successfully reconstructed if its sampling 
                             rate is not greater than the maximum frequency W. The samples are spaced at sampling time
                             'Ts' seconds apart without zero mean square error.</p>

                             <h4>Ts = 1/2W</h4>

                             <p>According to the sampling theory of the baseband signals, a signal can be successfully reconstructed if the samples are separated with a uniform intervals less than or equal to 1/2Fm.
     
                        </p>

                        <p>It can be represented as:</p>

                        <h4>Ts â‰¤ 1/2Fm</h4>

                        <h3>Nyquist rate</h3>

                       <p> Suppose H is the highest selected frequency. A bandlimited 
                        signal is transmitted at the frequency components lower than W Hz.
                         Thus, for the replication of the original 
                        signal, the sampling rate should be twice the highest frequency.</p>

                        <p>It is given by:</p>

                        <h4>Fs = 2W</h4>
                        <p>Where,

                            Fs is the sampling rate
                            
                            W is the highest frequency</p>

                            <p>Such rate of sampling is known as Nyquist rate.
                                 The sampling at the Nyquist rate does not introduce any distortion.

                                Nyquist rate is also known as the minimum sampling rate 
                                and is represented by the condition:</p>

                                <h4>Fs = 2Fm</h4>
                                <p>Where,

                                    Fs is the sampling frequency or sampling rate
                                    
                                    Fm is the maximum frequency of the input signal or the message signal</p>

                                    <h3>Nyquist Interval</h3>

                                    <p>Nyquist interval is the reciprocal of the Nyquist rate. It is given by:</p>
                                    <h4>TS = 1/2W</h4>

                                    <p>Where,

                                        TS is the Nyquist Interval
                                        
                                        W is the highest frequency</p>

                                        <h3>Methods of sampling</h3>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Ideal Sampling</li>

                                        </ul>

                                        <h4>Ideal Sampling</h4>
                                        <p>Ideal sampling is also known as instantaneous sampling or 
                                            impulse sampling. The sampling process multiplies the input signal and the carrier
                                             signal, which is present in the form of train of pulses.</p>

                                             <p>The above diagram shows the waveforms of the message signal,
                                                 sampling signal in the form of train of pulses, and the sampled signal.
                                                  The working principle that multiples
                                                 the input signal and the sampling signal is known as multiplication principle.</p>

                                                 <h4>Natural Sampling</h4>
                                                 <p>Natural Sampling is considered an efficient multiplexing method
                                                     in Pulse Amplitude Modulation. Here, the analog
                                                     signal is multiplied by the uniformly spaced rectangular pulses.</p>

                                                     <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/digital-communication/images/sampling4.png">

                                                     <h4>Flat-top sampling</h4>
                                                     <p>The design and reconstruction of flat-top sampling is
                                                         easy than the natural sampling process. The pulses in the flat-top 
                                                         sampling method are in the flat shape at the top and are held at a constant height. 
                                                        It means that the samples are flat and have constant amplitude.</p>

                                                        <h4>Anti-aliasing filter</h4>

                                                        <p>Aliasing is the common effect that can arise post the sampling process.
                                                             In the aliasing process, the high frequency components in the signal override the low frequency components.
                                                             The aliasing occurs when the signal frequency exceeds half the sampling frequency (Fs/2).</p>

                                                             <p>It can be represented as:</p>

                                                                    <p>The anti-aliasing filters are used to prevent the aliasing effect 
                                                                        during the transmission process. The cut-off frequency of such filters is equal 
                                                                        to half the sampling rate (Fs/2). The function of aliasing filters is to remove
                                                                         and filter the high-frequency components from the signal. It is inserted before the sampler. 
                                                                         It is also known as low-pass anti-aliasing filter. The signal after passing through the
