                    <p>Binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK), in which the carrier amplitude and carrier
                        phase are both maintained constant, while the carrier frequency is keyed between the
                        two possible values used to represent symbols 0 and 1.

                    <p>In binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK), symbols 0 and 1 are
                        distinguished from each other by transmitting one of two
                        sinusoidal waves that differ in frequency by a fixed amount.

            <h4>Binary data stream:</h4>
            <p>A binary data stream is a sequence of bits that represent digital information, such as text, images, audio, or video. Each bit is a binary digit that can have one of two possible values: 0 or 1. The bits are transmitted or stored in a sequential order, with each bit representing a unit of information.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h4>Carrier wave:</h4>
            <p> A carrier wave is a high-frequency signal that is modulated to carry information in a communication system. The carrier wave does not carry any information by itself but provides a stable platform for the modulation process. The frequency and amplitude of the carrier wave remain constant while the information is superimposed on it. The carrier wave is typically a sine wave, and its frequency determines the bandwidth of the communication channel.</p>
        </span>                    
        <span>
            <h4>Amplitude-shift keying (ASK):</h4>
            <p>Amplitude-shift keying is a digital modulation technique that uses the amplitude of a carrier wave to represent the binary data. In ASK, the amplitude of the carrier wave is switched between two different levels to represent 0 and 1 in the binary data stream. For example, if the carrier wave has an amplitude of A and A/2, it can represent 0 and 1, respectively. The receiver detects the amplitude changes in the carrier wave and decodes them back into the original binary data. ASK is a simple and efficient modulation technique but is sensitive to noise and distortion in the communication channel.</p>

        <img class="graph" src="/static/images/BFSK/1.png">
        <ol>
            <li>In BFSK, transmissions of symbols 1 and 0 are represented by two carrier waves of frequencies f1 and f2, respectively.</li>
            <li>The receiver consists of two paths, one dealing with frequency f1 (i.e., symbol 1) and the other dealing with frequency f2 (i.e., symbol 0)</li>
            <li>Path 1 uses a band-pass filter of mid-band frequency f1. The filtered version of the incoming BFSK signal is envelope-detected and then sampled at time t=iTb to produce the output v1.</li>
            <li>Path 2 uses a band-pass filter of mid-band frequency f2. As with path 2, filtered version of the BFSK signal is envelope detected and then sampled at time t=iTb to produce a different output v2.</li>
            <li>The outputs of the two paths, v1 and v2 are applied to a comparator, where decisions on the composition of the BFSK signal are repeated every seconds.</li>
